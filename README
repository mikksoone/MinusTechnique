MinusTechnique using conform-based sorting of rows. Some neat programming techniques from maker of LCM Takeaki Uno.

Required for compiling:
Cmake
C++0x compatible compiler

How to compile:
Create a directory "build" in the root directory. When in that dir, write "make" and Cmake will compile the program for you.

How to run:
minustechnique input_file outputfile

Multiplatform support:
Should work in linux and windows systems. Unfortunately currently only tested in linux. 

Visual Studio support:
Compiles, but haven't yet updated the makefile to support VS. Anyhow, it's easy to create a empty VS project and include the only source file here.

TODO:
Add the documentation about minustechnique algoritm itself
